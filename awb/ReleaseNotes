Version	Changes
-------	----------------------------------------------------------------
1.0		Initial release.  See README.txt for installation/usage info.

1.1		1. Added logging to a log file when applying rules.  After 
		   applying rules, check CSMARTer\CSMARTer.log for status re-
		   porting and error messages.  Many of the same messages are
		   logged to the log pane in the app, but log file adds provides
		   persistence.  Subsequent runs of the program overwrite the 
		   previous log file.
	
		2. Distribution directory restructuring: now ACMEPy is a 
		   subdirectory of CSMARTer, rather than being a sibling.  
		   Transparent to users.


1.2		1. Fixed various bugs, but most significant changes were those
		   enabling CSMARTer to run on Linux.  Though Python and wxPython
		   are platform-independent, Linux/GTK behaves differently from 
		   Windows in how widgets and controls respond and/or render 
		   themselves.  Note that there is not a separate version of the
		   CSMARTer software for Windows and Linux; rather, the same 
		   software now runs under both.
