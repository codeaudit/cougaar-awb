        			and agents from an 'x' in the label to white text on a 
				red background.  Also, fixed problem causing an infinite 
				loop when distributing agents	with a node excluded.  
				Finally, fixed bug that was allowing old text elements 
        			to remain in a TreeItemLabel obj even after the society
        			with which the label was associated had been closed.
